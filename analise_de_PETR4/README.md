# Stock Analysis: Price Evolution, Risk Metrics, and Investment Potential

The project aims to analyze a financial asset (a stock). In this study, I will conduct a descriptive analysis of the PETR4 (Petrobras) asset, attempting to understand the historical evolution of prices and returns.

Next, I will examine the distribution of these values, as well as measure their skewness, kurtosis, and normality. This may help us understand the risk and potential loss through Value at Risk (VaR).

Finally, we will analyze the main quantitative indicators, such as the Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios, which will help us assess whether investing in PETR4 is attractive or not, according to the risk-free rate (Selic), which is set at 8% per year.
